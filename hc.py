    Optimize a board by repeatedly choosing the best local move.

    This function should implement classic hill climbing: on each iteration,
    evaluate every one-step move for every hospital, choose the neighbor with
    the lowest cost, and move there only if it strictly improves the current
    cost. Stop when no improving neighbor exists.
